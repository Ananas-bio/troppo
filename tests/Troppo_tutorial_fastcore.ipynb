    "\n",
    "A typical workflow follows two main steps. The first is to attribute a score to each reaction of the model, in accordance with the omics data imputed. The second is to use the scores and apply an integration method to select a subset of reactions to build the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration scoring methods implemented in *Troppo* are:\n",
    "- continuous: `ContinuousScoreIntegrationStrategy`\n",
    "- threshold: `ThresholdSelectionIntegrationStrategy`\n",
    "- default_core: `DefaultCoreIntegrationStrategy`\n",
    "- adjusted_score: `AdjustedScoreIntegrationStrategy`\n",
    "- custom: `CustomSelectionIntegrationStrategy`\n",

    "\n",
    "This example can be applied for all the Omics integration methods implemented in this package. Note that the appropriate integration scoring method can differ between integration algorithms. For instance, for *GIMME* a continuous scoring method can be used, while for `fastcore` a threshold scoring method is more adequate.\n",
